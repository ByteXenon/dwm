# Luna's build of DWM (Dynamic Window Manager)

This is my custom build of DWM. It is based on [ChadWM](https://github.com/ChadSki/chadwm) which is a fork of the original [DWM](https://dwm.suckless.org/) by [Suckless](https://suckless.org/). I highly recommend you to check out the original DWM and ChadWM before using this build, because they're awesome.

## Luna's changes

- Made it pink and cute, because I like pink
- Removed the icons on the workspace bar
- Changed the font to Hack Nerd Font
- Added more workspace buttons, now there are 10 of them
- Some other changes I forgot about

## Installation

```
git clone https://github.com/ByteXenon/dwm
